## About-Me

Data-driven professional with a strong foundation in applied data science and machine learning, backed by MIT's AppliedData Science Program (ADSP). Proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, with expertise in supervised andunsupervised learning, regression analysis, recommendation systems, neural networks, and AI-driven decision-making.Skilled in statistical modeling, data visualization, and applying AI/ML techniques to real-world business problems.

Adept at leveraging automation to enhance efficiency, ensure data integrity, and drive strategic insights. Committed todelivering innovative, data-driven solutions that optimize productivity and align with organizational goals.

Key Skills and Qualifications:
- Developed expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and AI-driven decision-making.
- Applied supervised and unsupervised learning, including regression, classification,clustering, neural networks, and recommended systems
- Built recommendation systems and explored network analysis for real-world applications.
- Strengthened skills in Python, statistics, and data visualization with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Implemented time-series forecasting, decision trees, random forests, and computer visiontechniques.
- Gained hands-on experience with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch for modeldevelopment and deployment.

In my current role, I have been working as a Command Centre Engineer (Systems Specialist/Analyst) at VanCity Savings Credit
Union, where I focus on monitoring, automation, deployment, and troubleshooting within IT operations. My role involves
maintaining system stability, data workflows, and process automation while collaborating with cross-functional teams to
ensure operational efficiency. I work with Splunk, ServiceNow, PagerDuty, Control-M, and Azure Pipelines to monitor and
optimize system performance, manage ETL processes, and automate workflows for enhanced data processing and
reporting. Additionally, I contribute to documentation and knowledge management, ensuring consistency in technical
procedures and operational efficiency.

I have completed the Applied Data Science Program (ADSP) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I
advanced my expertise in supervised and unsupervised learning, machine learning, deep learning, and recommendation
systems. This builds upon my Data Analytics Diploma from Lighthouse Labs, where I gained hands-on experience with
Python, R, and PostgreSQL for statistical modeling and data visualization. Additionally, my Computer Information Systems
Administration (CISA) diploma from BCIT has provided me with a strong foundation in network management, cloud services,
and data security.

## Projects

### Car_Price_Prediction

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Car%20Price%20Prediction/car.jpeg" alt="logo">
</div>

- Description

  In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict car prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The process began with data cleaning and preprocessing, where I standardized column names, handled missing values, and converted categorical features into numerical representations. I then conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between the features and the target variable, MSRP, and normalized skewed distributions using logarithmic transformations. Feature engineering was an essential part of the project, where I created new features like car age and encoded categorical variables, adding interaction terms to capture complex relationships in the data. I implemented a baseline Linear Regression model, which I further refined using regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. The model was validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on training and validation datasets, achieving a competitive score that indicated strong predictive power and generalization capability. The final model provided accurate price predictions, identifying key factors such as engine specifications, vehicle size, and fuel type that influence car prices. This project demonstrated the practical application of data science techniques in the automotive industry, offering insights that could be used for pricing strategies and market analysis. The complete project can be viewed [here](link to your GitHub repository).
