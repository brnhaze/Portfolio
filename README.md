  - âœ… Content-Based Filtering: Applies TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to analyze song metadata for better recommendations.
  - âœ… Hybrid Approach: Combines SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and user-based filtering for optimized accuracy and personalization.
  - âœ… Performance Evaluation: Models are compared using Precision, Recall, RMSE, and F1-score to assess recommendation quality.

  Why This Matters:
  With the growing demand for personalized music experiences, this system helps users discover new songs aligned with their preferences. It can be scaled for real-world applications such as Spotify-like recommendation engines.
  
  ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:
  - Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise Library, NLTK, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity
  
  ðŸš€ Outcome:

- Description

  This project explores predicting country rankings based on cost of living and other economic factors. Using supervised learning techniques, I trained a model to compare the original top 10 country rankings with the predicted rankings, analyzing shifts and feature importance.

  ðŸ“Š Key Insights:
    - XGBoost Regressor was the best-performing algorithm.
    - Feature Importance Analysis revealed key economic factors driving predictions.
    - Some countries shifted in ranking, e.g., Belgium dropped from 3rd to 8th, showing that different variables influenced the final rankings.

  ðŸš€ Future Improvements:
    - Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy.
    - Exploring additional socioeconomic and environmental features.
    - Integrating deep learning for more complex ranking relationships.

- Technologies Used:
  - Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib & seaborn, XGBoost, scikit-learn)

### Car_Price_Prediction

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Car%20Price%20Prediction/car.jpeg" alt="logo">
</div>

- Description

  In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict car prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The process began with data cleaning and preprocessing, where I standardized column names, handled missing values, and converted categorical features into numerical representations. I then conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between the features and the target variable, MSRP, and normalized skewed distributions using logarithmic transformations. Feature engineering was an essential part of the project, where I created new features like car age and encoded categorical variables, adding interaction terms to capture complex relationships in the data. I implemented a baseline Linear Regression model, which I further refined using regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. The model was validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on training and validation datasets, achieving a competitive score that indicated strong predictive power and generalization capability. The final model provided accurate price predictions, identifying key factors such as engine specifications, vehicle size, and fuel type that influence car prices. This project demonstrated the practical application of data science techniques in the automotive industry, offering insights that could be used for pricing strategies and market analysis. The complete project can be viewed [here](link to your GitHub repository).
