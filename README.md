## üöÄ Featured Projects

### [üìä Building an ETL Pipeline for Canadian Retail Sales (MRTS)](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Module%208_Final_Project_Template.html)
This project develops a full **ETL pipeline** using the *Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS)* dataset from Statistics Canada to study long-term consumer spending patterns.  

- Extract 
  - Pulled raw data from multi-year Excel worksheets (1992‚Äì2021).  
  - Parsed NAICS codes, business categories, and monthly sales values.  
  - Generated both adjusted and non-adjusted versions to preserve seasonal insights.  

- Transform
  - Standardized dates into `YYYY-MM` format.  
  - Cleaned and harmonized ‚ÄúKind of Business‚Äù entries.  
  - Removed nulls, duplicates, and aggregated overlapping rows.  
  - Reshaped into a long-format table (`Kind of Business`, `YYYY_MM`, `Total_Sales`).  
  - Added derived metrics like month-over-month and year-over-year changes.  

- Load  
  - Exported the transformed dataset (~23,000+ records across 68 business categories) to CSV.  
  - Built Python installation scripts (`install_mrts_mysql.py`, `install_mrts_simple.py`) to create a MySQL database, define schema, and bulk-insert rows.  
  - Validated row counts and distinct categories in **MySQL Workbench**.  

  Outcome: 
  The ETL pipeline successfully converted raw survey data into a structured, queryable format. This enabled trend analysis, seasonal exploration, and forecasting of Canadian retail sales. Key insights include steady long-run growth, seasonal peaks during holidays, and sharp declines during economic shocks (2008, 2020).

### [üìä IBM HR Attrition Prediction](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Employee%20Attrition/Employee%20Attrition%20Prediction.html)
This project explores employee attrition using the IBM HR dataset, with the goal of predicting which employees are most likely to leave. The analysis begins with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns related to job roles, compensation, work-life balance, and overtime. These insights helped shape the modeling strategies and feature engineering decisions.

Multiple classification models were developed, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forest (with class weighting and hyperparameter tuning), and boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a particular focus on recall for the attrition class (label = 1), since it is more critical to identify at-risk employees.

Threshold tuning was applied to Logistic Regression and LDA models to improve sensitivity, and GridSearchCV was used to optimize decision tree and random forest hyperparameters. Feature importance was evaluated using SHAP values, with key predictors identified as OverTime, MonthlyIncome, JobRole, and WorkLifeBalance. These findings align with HR business intuition and can inform strategic retention programs.

The project was built using Python in Jupyter Notebook, and leverages libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and SHAP. All results are summarized in a business-facing report available below.

### [üìä IBM HR Attrition Prediction](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Employee%20Attrition/IBM%20HR%20Employee%20Attrition.html)
This project analyzes employee attrition using the IBM HR dataset and implements a range of classification models to predict which employees are most likely to leave the company. The analysis begins with thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends and relationships between features and attrition outcomes. Models such as Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) were trained and evaluated.

Feature importance was explored using SHAP to gain model-agnostic interpretability and explainability. Special focus was given to threshold optimization techniques to improve recall for the minority class (employees who left), which is critical for actionable HR interventions. Logistic Regression with a tuned threshold of 0.35 emerged as the most balanced and production-ready model, while LDA showed comparable performance after threshold adjustment. KNN and QDA were found to overfit to the minority class without class-balancing methods.

This project was developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It leverages pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization. scikit-learn was used extensively for modeling, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter tuning through GridSearchCV. SHAP was applied for detailed model interpretation, particularly to visualize how features like OverTime, JobRole, and MaritalStatus impact attrition risk. The final notebook provides a clear, business-friendly summary with actionable insights and model recommendations.

### [üìà Network Stock Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Stocks/Network_Stock_Portfolio_Optimization_2.html)
This project simulates and compares investment strategies using S&P 500 stock data and network-based clustering. It involves downloading historical price data with the `yfinance` API, isolating 'Close' prices from multi-index DataFrames, and cleaning the dataset for analysis. The simulation evaluates portfolio growth for different initial investments and compares the performance of central and peripheral portfolios against the S&P 500 benchmark, with results visualized using matplotlib.
