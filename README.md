## üöÄ Featured Projects

### [ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction (Deep Learning)](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Diabetes/Predicting%20Chance%20of%20Diabetes%20Deep%20Learning%20Regression.html)
Builds multiple deep learning models to classify diabetes risk using clinical data. Compares model architectures and evaluates performance using training/validation/test metrics. Applies TensorFlow and Keras with preprocessing and EDA done using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.

### ü©∫ Liver Disease Image Classification (Deep Learning)
Built two progressive deep learning pipelines to classify liver disease tissue images using histopathology data.
- [**Notebook 1:**](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Liver%20Disease/Liver%20Disease%20Deep%20learning%20image%20Classification%201.html) Developed a custom CNN model trained on 128√ó128 resized liver images. Served as a baseline using fundamental convolutional layers for binary classification. Focused on building a functional pipeline from scratch using raw image data. Implemented using TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib for training, visualization, and evaluation.
- [**Notebook 2:**](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Liver%20Disease/Liver%20Disease%20Deep%20learning%20image%20Classification%202.html) Rebuilt and improved the project using transfer learning (VGG16), upgraded input size (224√ó224), and added multiple deep learning models. This version addressed memory issues from the first notebook, added better evaluation with confusion matrices and accuracy/loss comparisons, and delivered stronger performance. Utilized TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and VGG16 from `keras.applications` for enhanced modeling and analysis.

### [ü©∫ Liver Disease Prediction (Deep Learning)](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Liver%20Disease/Predicting_Liver_Disease_Using_Machine_Learning_A_Data_Driven_Approach_in_Binary_Classification.html)
Uses neural networks and ensemble models to predict liver disease. Applied TensorFlow, Keras, XGBoost, and LightGBM, with preprocessing and EDA done using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.

### üêâ Dragon Ball Z: Data Science Saga‚ö°
Explore the universe of Dragon Ball Z through the lens of data analytics and machine learning. This series of notebooks walks through the full data science pipeline‚Äîstarting with EDA and moving through clustering, regression, classification, and model evaluation‚Äîall themed with your favorite DBZ characters and features.
- [**Notebook 1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/DragonBall/1%20EDA.html) In this notebook, we explore the raw Dragon Ball Z dataset, clean missing values, visualize relationships between characters and their attributes, and discover patterns in power levels, transformations, and classes. It sets the stage for future modeling work.
- [**Notebook 2: Unsupervised Learning:**](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/DragonBall/2%20Unsupervised%20Learning.html) We use K-Means clustering and PCA to uncover natural groupings among DBZ characters without using predefined labels. This allows us to see which fighters cluster together based on their stats‚ÄîSaiyans vs villains, elite warriors vs newcomers.
- [**Notebook 3: Supervised Learning ‚Äì Linear Regression:**](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/DragonBall/3%20Supervised%20Learning%20Regression.html) This notebook trains linear regression models to predict power levels based on other character attributes like attack, defense, and energy. We evaluate model fit, visualize predictions, and assess residuals for improvements.
- [**Notebook 4: Regularized Regression ‚Äì Lasso & Ridge:**](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/DragonBall/4%20Supervised%20Learning%20Regression%20Lasso_Ridge.html) We apply Lasso and Ridge regression to the same predictive task from Notebook 3, now incorporating regularization to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Hyperparameter tuning is included to optimize performance.
- [**Notebook 5: Supervised Learning ‚Äì Classification:**](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/DragonBall/5%20Supervised%20Learning%20Classification.html) This project tackles classification of characters into different fighter categories using models like logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Evaluation includes confusion matrices and accuracy scores to find the top performers.
- [**Notebook 6: Advanced Regression ‚Äì Continuous Targets:**](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/DragonBall/6%20Supervised%20Learning%20Regression%20Continuous.html) We dive deeper into regression tasks involving continuous variables beyond just power level‚Äîpossibly attack range, speed score, or fusion strength. Multiple regression techniques are compared for best results.
- - [**Notebook 7: Classification with Decision Trees & Ensemble Methods:**](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/DragonBall/7%20Supervised%20Learning%20Classification%20with%20Decision%20Trees%20etc.html) We implement decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to classify characters based on their DBZ profile. Feature importance helps us understand which traits make a Z-Fighter legendary.
  
### [üéµ Music Genre Classification](https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Music%20Genre/Music%20Genre%20Classification%20using%20Deep%20Learning.html)
