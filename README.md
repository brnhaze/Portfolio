## About-Me

I completed the Data Analytics Digital Diploma Program at Lighthouse Labs, where I gained extensive experience in data collection, processing, and analysis. My proficiency with data visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI, coupled with my expertise in programming languages like Python and SQL, enables me to transform complex data sets into meaningful insights.

Key Skills and Qualifications:
- Data Visualization & Dashboards: Proficient in Tableau, Power BI; skilled in data storytelling and design principles.
- Programming & Scripting: Expertise in Python, SQL, R; experience in data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- Data Analysis & Reporting: Strong analytical skills; adept at using data to drive strategic decisions and reporting.
- Communication & Collaboration: Effective communicator; able to convey complex technical information to diverse audiences.
- Marketing Analytics: Completed courses in Digital Marketing Analytics and Digital Marketing, providing a strong foundation in using data to drive marketing strategies.

In my current role as a Systems Specialist | Analyst in Operations at Vancouver City Savings Credit Union, I manage system monitoring through various dashboards, respond to system events and alerts, and utilize SIEM tools like Splunk to ensure the stability and security of services. This role has refined my analytical and problem-solving abilities, which are crucial for a data-driven environment.

My educational background includes a Computer Information Systems Administration Diploma from the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) and a Google Cybersecurity Certificate from Coursera. These programs have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of IT infrastructure, cybersecurity principles, and data analysis techniques. Additionally, I have completed specialized courses in digital marketing through Udemy, enhancing my ability to analyze marketing data and develop strategies to optimize campaigns.

## Projects

### Car_Price_Prediction

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/brnhaze/Portfolio/blob/main/Car%20Price%20Prediction/car.jpeg" alt="logo">
</div>

- Description

  In the Car Price Prediction project, I leveraged machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to predict car prices based on a dataset from Kaggle. The process begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, where I addressed issues like inconsistent column naming and missing values. After organizing the data, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of key features such as engine horsepower, fuel type, and vehicle size. The core of the project is building a linear regression model that uses these features to predict the MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) of cars. By applying logarithmic transformations to reduce skewness and stabilize variance, I improved the model's performance. The linear regression model was trained, validated, and tested on different subsets of the data, with the final output being a predicted price for each vehicle. The project showcases my ability to work with real-world data, apply statistical methods, and implement machine learning models using Python and TensorFlow.
